Wing Chun Terms
===============

A simple online flash-card tool for Wing Chun terms used at the `Ridings Wing Chun Kung Fu Academy`_
targeted at the iPhone4(s) using HTML5, media queries and CoffeeScript to try and create an 
off-line webapp.

The plan is to add more terms and cantonese words over time to help fill-out one's vocabulary,
while also learning a little more about iPhone-specific webapp development.

Planned Features
----------------

- Flipping terms/translations
- Resizing terms to fit the screen/window better
- Targeting iPads & Android
- Allowing Timer options so each term/card can only be viewed for a number 
  of seconds before automatically moving on
- Additional descriptive text for terms, shown after translation.
